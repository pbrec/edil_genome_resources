# edil_genome_resources

This repository contains our _Euglossa dilemma_ genome resources.  

The official gene set `Edil_OGS_v1.0` was created using a combination of homology-based and _de novo_ gene predictions. Homology-based gene predictions are based on the honey bee [OGSv3.2](http://hymenopteragenome.org/beebase/?q=download_sequences). The file `Edil_OGS_v1.0_apis_gene_homology.txt` contains the honey bee genes used as parents for each gene identified in the homology-based approach.
